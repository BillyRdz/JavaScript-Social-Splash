## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

I created a data object in Javascript to use and render to the HTML. Creating elements and looping through nodes to create additional nodes. As well as using Javascript to inser the HTML and CSS to show how different aspects of Javascript can be used.

## Optimizations

We can update the links to first require an input and update the link src to allow easier manipulation of what get's rendered.

## Lessons Learned:

- Creating Elements with Javascript
- Retrieving Elements by Tagname
- Looping through nodes to create additional nodes
